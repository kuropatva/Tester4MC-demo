Testing library for dynamic integration tests of Java Minecraft Spigot server plugins.

### How to use

*Warning:* By default, this library **does NOT automatically deploy your recompiled project to the server instance**.
It might be a good idea to keep this library in a separate repository from your main project and to isolate it from standard unit tests.
